# values-world-map

This project involves coding a world map in JavaScript using the D3.js library, which allows for data visualization and interactive graphics on the web. The map will have inputs for all countries of the following values: Environmental stewardship, Social justice, Economic equity, Inter-generational equity, Holistic thinking, Collaboration and community building, Innovation and creativity, Responsibility and accountability, Respect for diversity, and Ethics and values. These values represent different sustainability values that can be assigned to each country on the map.

Here are the steps for this project:

- Prepare the data: Collect data for each country regarding their values for Environmental stewardship, Social justice, Economic equity, Inter-generational equity, Holistic thinking, Collaboration and community building, Innovation and creativity, Responsibility and accountability, Respect for diversity, and Ethics and values. The data can be stored in a CSV file or any other format that can be easily read by JavaScript.
- Load the data: Load the data into the JavaScript code using the D3.js library. Use the d3.csv() function to read the CSV file and create an array of data objects.
- Create the map: Use the D3.js library to create a map of the world. You can use a GeoJSON file to draw the map outlines.
- Assign values to each country: Using the data array created in step 2, assign values to each country on the map. You can use a color scale or other visual cues to represent the different sustainability values.
- Add interactive features: You can add interactive features to the map, such as tooltips or popups, that display the values for each country when the user hovers over it.
- Test and refine: Test the map and refine it until you are satisfied with the final result.

Once completed, this world map with inputs for all countries of the mentioned values can be used as a tool to visualize and communicate the sustainability values of different countries around the world.
